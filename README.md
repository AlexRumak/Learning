# Learning - A repository for code snippets and exercises that I'm learning.

This repository is a public record of things I'm currently learning. Reference
it to see what I'm currently doing in the programming realm or data analysis 
realm in terms of learning. 

Some of my projects are private, some are public, but I think it's good to show
case what you are learning and so this repository was born!

## Learning Topics

### Crafting Interpreters

**Folder**: CraftingInterpreters

I am learning to build interpreters. This started as a personal project when I
started trying to learn to parse yaml in C from scratch with no libraries. This
effort can be seen [here](https://github.com/AlexRumak/simplesitegenerator).
